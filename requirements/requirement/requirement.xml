     <title>Requirement</title>
    <para>As mentioned in the introduction, we would like to build a robotic platform, but what is a
        robotic platform ?</para>
    <para>For us, a platform represents a set of flexible robots, based on a common base, such as a
        common software, common electronics, standard tool holders, standards parts, etc. The
            <emphasis>gribot</emphasis> platform could, for example, allow the creation of a small
        mower robot, as well as a high clearance robot to work on mounds of crops.</para>
    <para>This means that, in the long term, there will not be just one robot, but a family that, we
        hope, will allow great flexibility in working in agriculture.</para>
    <para>In a first step, we will focus on a mower robot, allowing the maintenance of the grass in
        the crops, because it is a need that we quickly identified. However, as more needs are
        identified, or ideas emerge, we will document these needs.</para>
