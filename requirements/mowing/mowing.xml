     <title>Mowing</title>
     <para>As mentioned above, the mower robot will be the first element of the
            <emphasis>gribot</emphasis> robotic platform. There are several reasons for this choice:
        grass care in crops is unproductive, time-consuming and uses a lot of non-renewable energy
        unnecessarily. We estimated that maintaining the grass in one hectare of fruit trees
        consumed about 100 liters of fuel oil per year and required almost a week's work.</para>
    <para>We also noticed that such a robot would be useful in many other places outside
        agriculture, such as roadside maintenance, grass mowing in industrial plots, community plot
        maintenance, in short, any grassy surface, not always very flat, requiring regular
        mowing.</para>
    <para>The requirement for the mower robot are listed below.</para>
    <para>
        <itemizedlist>
            <listitem>
                <para>The robot should not exceed 60cm in width, in order to easily slip between
                    fruit trees or vines.</para>
            </listitem>
            <listitem>
                <para>The height of the robot should not exceed 30 to 40 cm in order to be able to
                    slip under fruit trees or vines.</para>
            </listitem>
            <listitem>
                <para>The robot should be able to maintain 20,000 m<superscript>2</superscript>

            </listitem>
            <listitem>
                <para>The robot's working surface must under no circumstances be made by burying a
                    wire, as is done for lawn care robots. An electronic means, such as GPS or other
                    positioning system, will always be preferable.</para>
            </listitem>
            <listitem>

                    order to avoid them.</para>
            </listitem>
            <listitem>
                <para>The robot must implement a strategy to optimize its work in order to save its

                <para>Users and animals must not be allowed to come into contact with moving parts
                    of the robot. For example, it is possible to detect a presence in the robot
                    environment and to stop any moving parts.</para>

                    time, for example 6 hours, may be allowed on a stand-alone charging
                    station.</para>
