# Project and documentation organization

At the time being, the project documentation is organized into two main folders:

* Requirement
* Specifications

New folders will appear as long as the project evolvre.

A folder called "old_spec" still exists in the document hierarchy, but it will desapear soon.

The project documentation is in constant evolution: it is continuously improved, as developments progress, and it is enriched with the arrival of new functionalities.

# Specifications

For the time being, Gribot documents are written in docbook, with Oxygen XML Editor.

Specification are beinbg reorganized. The old specification are located in folder old_spec/out/pdf/main.pdf, while the new will be split according to the project steps in different folder.

# Free editing tools

Oxygen XML Editor is a paid application. However, [XMLmind](http://www.xmlmind.com/xmleditor/docbook_editor.html) is available for free.

# File naming convention

These are some simple file naming rules. They have been written in order to simplify project life.

* All files are written in lowercase.
* Folders are written in lowercase.
* Each chapter has a dedicated folder with all related files in it.
* Chapter folder name is the same as the main chapter file.
* Chapter file name is the same as the chapter title, with spaces replaces by underscore.
